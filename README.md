# ctf

My CTF folder for events, mostly.

I moved to this structure after Defcon Quals 2016, from what I had previously. Hopefully I keep to it a little better, since things were a complete mess prior to that. I have my old CTF folders, but they're not in any usable state.

## Structure:

CTF/events/ctf name/chal name/actual content

CTF events. The intention is to use these directories as my actual play-area during CTFs and upload when I'm done.

CTF/tests

The tests folder is used for things I'm testing out. If they become something more than something stupid I'm playing with, I'll break it out into it's own repo (if I get around to it, no promises)

CTF/tests/binja

Some basic [Binary Ninja](http://binary.ninja) scripts I've been playing with. They're mostly hacky and bad, but partially useful.
