Looks pretty simple. Connect, get a cryptographer, submit the year of their birth.

Pretty short timeout, though.

I briefly considered a more complete solution:
 * Pull down the wikipedia database and mine it, since they're all in the modern cryptographers group
 * Set up requesting info from google

 But neither of those made sense, since I assumed a <50 total answers. I just threw together a dict and manually looked things up until I got a flag.
