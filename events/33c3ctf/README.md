#33c3ctf

## Summary
[33c3ctf](https://ctftime.org/event/404) was run from Tuesday, Dec 27 at 3PM - Thursday, Dec 29 3PM. I played with Mammon Machine, and we finished in 43rd for the event. I solved the following challenges:

* Pwnables
  * babyfengshui - a "simple" heap overflow
  * espr - format string vuln exploited essentially blind
  * grunt - lua script with vuln in the C side of things

* Web
  * pay2win - a crypto-y web. Stumbled into a solution here

* Misc
  * pdfmaker - latex to read/write a flag file with unknown file name
  * try - haskell/GIF polyglot
  * exfil - pcap of dns tunneling of a shell

Overall, I thought the compitition was quite good. The pwnables I solved all felt quite good, high quality challenges. 

grunt, in particular, I had a ton of fun solving and would like to see more of in future CTFs. It seems like an easy way to make a challenge with browser-style exploitation, without having to make it be a real browser. I'm sure it's been done before and I missed it, but I'm honestly shocked I haven't seen more challenges like this. I'd love to see more as a trend for 2017.

My only disappointment is that I had a prior commitment and could only really spend half the time playing. I may go back and solve some of the other pwnables I didn't get time to look at, given that the calendar seems kind of empty for the first half January.


Thanks @EatSleepPwnRpt, for a great CTF.
