No idea how this thing really works.

I noticed the first 32 bytes of the "cheap" and "flag" blobs were the same, and that the last 32 bytes of the "cheap" and "complete" blobs were the same. I mixed the flag and complete, and got a flag.

I assume it's some sort of block based crypto, which stores things weird. But hey, it worked.
