# Solved:

## fb

single null-byte heap overflow with no pointer leak but no PIE.

## loopandloop

android RE, combination of native/non-native code to follow

## Welcome

the gimme challenge

# Mostly solved:

## vss

Worked local, didn't work remote and I didn't feel like tracking it down for so few points.

# unsolved

## routers

Vuln found, didn't have time to finish landing it: still thinking about going back to finish

## coloroverflow

Pulled partial APKs out of pcap, kept missing a few bytes and didn't ever get the full thing.

##  timemachine

Similar to loopandloop, but I decided I would rather do fb and routers.
