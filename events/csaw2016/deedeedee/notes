Well, this is embarassing...

 "gl`gzt2mql`t2_leu4qr1gsalmhnf_hs^gs8^4^3wesy1n2}" is the flag.

 I noticed that that looks a lot like flag{...}, but with every other character offset by one ascii value.

 So I tried that, adding -1,0,1,0

 and it got close enough to read the flag, and only took a few manual changes to get points.
