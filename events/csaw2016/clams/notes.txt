Used photorec to pull off deleted powerpoint.

Found online copy of powerpoint, unzipped both (since powerpoints are just zips of their components), compared the list of files.

The one from the drive had a gif, which turned out to be a MaxiCode barcode.

Used some random android app to scan it, got a flag.
